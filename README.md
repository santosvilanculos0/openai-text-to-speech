# Open AI - Text to Speech

This project demonstrates the implementation of OpenAI's Text-to-Speech API. It converts text from an `input.txt` file to speech and saves the output as `output.mp3` using OpenAI's services.

## Setup

1. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` in the root folder.
2. Set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` variable in the `.env` file with your OpenAI API key.

### Input Text

Place the text you want to convert to speech in the `input.txt` file located in the root folder.

## Usage

1. Run the script or application.
2. The content from `input.txt` will be used by the application with OpenAI's Text-to-Speech API to generate speech.
3. The resulting speech will be saved as `output.mp3` in the root folder.
